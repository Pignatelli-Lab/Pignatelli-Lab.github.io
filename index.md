## About
Welcome to the Pignatelli Lab's GitHub page!
This page serves as a centralized hub for data analysis workflows associated with our lab's publications. Workflows are organized by publication as Github repositories. Each repository contains a README file with a brief description of the workflows and instructions for reproducing the results. All data are presented in a readily analyzable format, but raw data can be made available upon request.

Visit our lab's main website [here](https://pignatellilab.org).

For correspondence regarding the Pignatelli Lab or its publications, please contact [Dr. Marco Pignatelli](mailto:marco.pignatelli@wustl.edu?subject=Pignatelli%20Lab%20Correspondence).

Please direct any questions/comments regarding the upkeep of this site or its associated repositories to [Jacob Roeglin](mailto:jacob.roeglin@wustl.edu?subject=Pignatelli%Lab%Github%Page).
